# Generative_AI

Generative AI, or generative artificial intelligence, is a type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, music, audio, and videos. Generative AI models learn the structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics. It is powered by foundation models (large AI models) that can multi-task and perform out-of-the-box tasks, including summarization, Q&A, classification, and more. Plus, with minimal training required, foundation models can be adapted for targeted use cases with very little example data.
